## Suave Drone ROS Package

This package is based on the template provided by Josh Newans https://github.com/joshnewans/my_bot and modified for use in the SUAVE drone swarm project by the Engineering Phyics Propulsion Laboratory (EPPL) at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)

This repository currently covers the bare essentials required to simulate different methods of Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) navigation for the drone swarm, and will not include swarm control or other unneccesary systems at this time. The simulation will be done using a simple differential drive robot with a caster wheel to approximate the mobility of a quadcopter style drone, with plans to update to include these modules as the project develops. This method of simulation was chosen because it allows for similar mobility to a drone with the benefit of simplicity of design.
